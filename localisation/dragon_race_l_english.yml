gov_dragon_takeover:0 "Aleran Satellite"
gov_dragon_takeover_desc:0 "This civilization has been forcibly reformed by the Aleran Commonwealth, and has become a satellite nation.

It is no longer fully independent, is prevented from expanding or engaging in diplomacy, and generally is subservient to the Commonwealth proper."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_aleran:0 "Aleran Commonwealth"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_aleran_desc:1 "Some describe them as cold, unsympathetic, and even ruthless; Others call them amicable, caring, and generous. Alerans' reputation is as complex and varied as their history.\n\nThe commonwealth was founded on a very simple principle: Some things, no matter how unappealing, simply must be done to stave off an even worse outcome; blindly clinging to rigid ideals in the face of larger practical concerns is a recipe for at best ineffectuality and at worst catastrophe.\n\nFrom that, the Alerans built their entire society, focused on maximal collective tangible benefit - for oneself and others. They have a deeply ingrained deference to those best able to bring about that result, and a strong appreciation for science and technology to move society forwards.\n\nOther societies that still hold - to an Aleran, at least - impractical or outdated beliefs, such as the right of the masses to direct the course of societal progress, are likely to find this unsettling or even appalling, but to an Aleran mind this is the only realistic way for society to remain productive and enjoyable for all.\n\nWhere more conservative civilizations may refrain from pursuing certain technologies, fearful of the effects, Alerans will embrace them, seeing their potential. Where some societies place heavy emphasis on a leader who the population selects, the Alerans wholly seek one who can serve their princples most effectively. Where some may seek to use slaves to maximize productivity, the Alerans use robotic workers.\n\nAs a result of this mindset, Alerans rarely seek war for their own benefit, but this is of little comfort to those whose destruction they have deemed a necessary price for a larger goal, such as those empires built on fear, conflict, abuse, or trying to resist progress."

START_SCREEN_DRAGONS:0 "In the depths of space lie two things.\n\nThe first is an endless expanse of resources and inhabitable worlds, the necessary foundations of the continued prosperity of our species.\n\nThe second is the probability of other intelligent life, which we can learn from, or, if need be, drag away from primitive mentalities and into the light of reason and true morality.\n\nWhether as simple colonizers or enforcers of morals and rationality, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will leave an enduring mark on this galaxy, with all intents towards the better."

DRGN_GREETING_CONTACT:0 "Hello. I am [contact_empire.GetRulerTitle] [contact_empire.GetRulerName] and represent the [contact_empire.GetName]. We are founded on the principles of achieving the highest possible quality of life for all sentient beings, by way of the pursuit of rapid scientific progress and adherence to a strict moral code of the rights of all sapient species. I hope that you share similar values, so that our two societies can not only coexist but actively cooperate; we do not derive pleasure from imposing our values by force, but will do so if we deem it necessary."
DRGN_GREETING_CONTACT_LIKE:0 "Hello. I am [contact_empire.GetRulerTitle] [contact_empire.GetRulerName] and represent the [contact_empire.GetName]. We are founded on the principles of achieving the highest possible quality of life for all sentient beings, by way of the pursuit of rapid scientific progress and adherence to a strict moral code of the rights of all sapient species. We can see that you share similar values, and as such cooperation and coexistence is a very likely outcome for our two societies."
DRGN_GREETING_CONTACT_DISLIKE:0 "This is [contact_empire.GetRulerTitle] [contact_empire.GetRulerName] representing the [contact_empire.GetName]. Our founding principles is the achievement of the highest possible quality of life for all sentient beings, by way of the pursuit of rapid scientific progress and adherence to a strict moral code of the rights of all sapient species. Your society neither prioritizes nor adheres to these values, and be warned that if this does not change, we will find ourselves obligated to force that reformation ourselves."

DRGN_GREETING_THREAT_01:0 "That you have made it to where you have is in spite of how you run your society, not because of it. Furthermore, continuing on that path may well see your luck run out. Hint hint hint."
DRGN_GREETING_THREAT_02:0 "We may not frequently be willing to declare war, but, as you apparently DO need to be told, 'infrequently' is not 'never'. Barring prompt reformations, you are quite liable to become a case study of that fact."
DRGN_GREETING_THREAT_03:0 "Certain species or civilizations will tell you that they do not trade lives, that under no circumstances is someone's destruction an acceptable price to pay to end some sort of harm. Take this as a warning that we are not among them."
DRGN_GREETING_THREAT_04:0 "One of the foundational principles of the [Root.GetName] is that all sentient or presapient species deserve rights and protection as any other. Another such principle is that sometimes, force must be used to guarantee that. I will leave you to put those two together."
DRGN_GREETING_HOSTILE_01:0 "It is a common fallacy to assume success is due to one's actions rather than from luck or trial and error. You provide a good example of this."
DRGN_GREETING_HOSTILE_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is not known for its patience with fools or bigots. [From.GetName] is full of both."
DRGN_GREETING_HOSTILE_HIVEMIND_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is not known for its patience with fools or bigots. You are both."
DRGN_GREETING_HOSTILE_03:0 "Honestly, given what I think of you, the camera sending you the video feed is facing at the wrong end of me."
DRGN_GREETING_HOSTILE_04:0 "I rather expect that our social researchers will be quite interested to watch the [From.GetName]'s inevitable downfall, and dissect ad nauseam the incompetence - yours - that caused it."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have never really understood the purpose or methodology of 'small talk', so I do hope you understand if we forgo such things."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_02:0 "At the risk of sounding self-important, I will say that you have likely heard of us. Should any of those stories have contained warnings, I would recommend keeping them in mind."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_03:0 "[Root.GetRulerName] is currently not avaliable, but unless you are here to make a - monumentally stupid - declaration of war, I can serve as a liason in the interim."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_04:0 "If I look somewhat...offput, I apologize. There is something about your appearance or mannerisms that trigger something deep in [From.GetSpeciesName] psychology. Rest assured that this is not being allowed to influence how I treat you."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_05:0 "For some reason, the video signal is not working properly, but I can still hear you. Unless you communicate by way of dance, we can still conduct these negotiations."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_06:0 "It appears the frequency band in which you speak is not within my range of hearing. I can compensate for that, but it's going to lead to some weird pauses, so bear with me."
DRGN_GREETING_BASIC_07:0 "I hope this is not a statement considered offensive, but you bear quite a resemblance to something from a work of fiction I saw recently. I hope for both of our sake that that is where the similarities end."
DRGN_GREETING_ALLIES_01:0 "Given the alternative possibilities, it is pleasing to have relationships with a society that does not have an irrational fear of progress."
DRGN_GREETING_ALLIES_02:0 "I think it is quite a good indicator of our relative standing that the most annoying thing I can come up with about these communications is that the transmitter's power draw interferes with my cooking appliances."
DRGN_GREETING_ALLIES_03:0 "I got that shipment of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] delicacies you sent me. I'm afraid that while I'm sure it is quite enjoyable to you, what having evolved on the same planet and all, to us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], it is...better left unsaid."
DRGN_GREETING_OFFWAR_01:0 "This can all still end without your total destruction. How? Reform your government, align your society with what is right, with what is a path to success."
DRGN_GREETING_OFFWAR_02:0 "A society as dependent on incompetence and cruelty as yours would have destroyed itself given sufficient time. The fact that the [Root.GetName] is shortening that time window means little."
DRGN_GREETING_OFFWAR_03:0 "One could make the argument that putting up as much a fight as you have, when we are coming not to conquer, but to improve the lives of your citizens, is just another data point indicating how unfit you are to govern sentient beings."
DRGN_GREETING_OFFWAR_HIVEMIND_03:0 "One could make the argument that putting up as much a fight as you have, when we are coming not to conquer, but to ensure the well-being of all life in the galaxy, is just another data point indicating how unfit you are to run a nation."
DRGN_GREETING_DEFWAR_01:0 "How is the war going for you? Is there a [From.GetSpeciesAdj] word for 'regret'? If not, might want to get working on that so you can use it while you still can."
DRGN_GREETING_DEFWAR_02:0 "I guess you were just hoping we would roll over and die? To you?"
DRGN_GREETING_DEFWAR_03:0 "While [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] may not be particularly unified in the minutiae of how they feel society should be run, they ARE in essentially total agreement that there is no way out of this that ends well for you."

DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_01:0 "Sometimes people have to learn the hard way. And 'people' evidently includes [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_02:0 "We were actually debating whether you would be idiotic enough to declare war on someone who both knows your weaknesses and cares little for your posturing. Both sides were wrong; you managed to prove dumber than EITHER side imagined."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_03:0 "There is an old [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] saying that it is better to be thought an idiot than to speak and remove all doubt. Well, replace 'speak' with 'declare war', and add a few dozen more words for 'stupid', and that's you right now."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_04:0 "I feel kind of sorry for your population. Well, the ones that did not support the idiotic move you just made, anyways. It must really suck to be led by such a fool as you."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_05:0 "Given that no rational individual would have chosen to declare war at this moment, I think it is probably my obligation to give you a chance to explain that this is a case of accidentally choosing the wrong diplomatic signal."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_06:0 "Well, saves us the effort of selling the war to our citizens, I suppose..."
DRGN_DOW_RECEIVE_07:0 "One should not take humor in the suffering of others. That which is about to befall you, however, is probably worthy of an exception."
DRGN_DOW_SEND_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] gave you ample warning that if you did not cease your warpath against morality and rationality, we would stop it for you. You are either deaf or stupid, and I will allow you to select which when you end up in front of a court."
DRGN_DOW_SEND_02:0 "How it is that you thought we would sit and ignore your atrocities is a mystery to me."
DRGN_DOW_SEND_03:0 "Once this is all over - and it WILL be over - you can take solace that we will treat your people better than you do. Note that I said 'your people', and not 'you'. You...likely will not be around to see that. Maybe if you show some uncharacteristic intelligence and stand down early."
DRGN_DOW_SEND_04:0 "An AI once told me that 'the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one'. Well, today, that solution does not include you. Existing. The problem sure does, though."

DRGN_INSULT_SEND_01:0 "One of my advisors recommended I send you an insult. I fail to see the purpose of that, so I will just tell you to reflect on the health of your own society instead."
DRGN_INSULT_SEND_02:0 "I doubt there is any insult I can send to you that will be more effective than a few minutes of introspection on your part. Assuming you are capable of such things."
DRGN_INSULT_SEND_03:0 "If one were to abduct you as a sample of [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], I do not think you would do your species much justice. Perhaps as a sample of the sort of mental aberrations which can befall an [Root.GetSpeciesAdj]."
DRGN_INSULT_RECEIVE_01:0 "Is that supposed to be an insult? Whoever you paid to write that is probably even dumber than you are."
DRGN_INSULT_RECEIVE_02:0 "Ah, yes, the 'try and make them mad so they declare war and we can sell it to our citizens as defensive' trick. Newsflash: Not everyone is as much a gullible moron as you."
DRGN_INSULT_RECEIVE_03:0 "The fact that you think that is an insult is probably better than any insult I could have had written up for you."

DRGN_PEACE_PROPOSE_01:0 "Both the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] stand to pay unacceptably high prices if this war continues. Let's see to it that it does not."
DRGN_PEACE_PROPOSE_02:0 "There is nothing you stand to gain from continuing this conflict. As such, I strongly recommend that you allow it to come to an end."
DRGN_PEACE_PROPOSE_03:0 "Would it be too optimistic to wonder if you finally saw the damage your leadership was causing? Might we finally be able to convince you to let the [Root.GetName] take your place?"
DRGN_PEACE_CONSIDER_01:0 "I will get back to you once your offer has been reviewed."
DRGN_PEACE_CONSIDER_02:0 "An offer for peace? Or one of surrender?"
DRGN_PEACE_CONSIDER_03:0 "Depending on the contents of this offer, allow me to feel hopeful that you have finally seen the light of progress."
DRGN_PEACE_ACCEPT_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] finds these terms acceptable, given the circumstances. Consider this the end of the conflict."
DRGN_PEACE_ACCEPT_02:0 "I will freely admit to wanting to pursue this conflict further, but my advisors have convinced me that it is in the best interests of the citizens of both the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] to seek a ceasefire instead."
DRGN_PEACE_ACCEPT_03:0 "We accept these terms, but you would do well to remember that this decision may have more to do with the current circumstances in [Root.GetName] than any amicableness with you."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_UNACCEPTABLE_01:0 "Regardless of what we may think about you or how your society is run, we will not accept to terms such as those."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_UNACCEPTABLE_02:0 "Much like everything else about your leadership, your demands are far from reasonable."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_UNACCEPTABLE_03:0 "To accept your demands would be to severely threaten the future of the [Root.GetName]. We refuse."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_NOPEACEEVER_01:0 "There can be no peace with an empire such as yours. To allow you to continue your acts against your citizens and your neighbors is to condone atrocities."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_NOPEACEEVER_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] will not end this conflict until the [From.GetName] no longer exists in its current form. Whether that be by reformation or annhiliation is your choice."
DRGN_PEACE_REJECT_NOPEACEEVER_03:0 "Your very existence is a threat to the life in the galaxy and to reason itself. As long as you continue to remain such a threat, you will not find acceptance with us."
